== Debugging Warp

In order to debug Warp execution effectively, one needs to know few facts:

* Warp tries to provide as much context during its failures as possible
** (if you are not provided with a context of a failure, let's report it)
* the client-side execution can be debugged by usual approaches
* the server-side execution can be debugged by usual approaches
* Arquillian's debug output can reveal issues

=== Arquillian Debugging Mode

In order to debug the tests effectively, one can reveal their internals by switching into the Arquillian debugging mode:

*just pass `-Darquillian.debug=true` to the test and application server VM*.

It will show an event tree in a console which exposes you:

* what events are happening during test execution
* what requests/responses were registered by Warp
* what requests/responses were inspected by Warp
* what lifecycle hooks were hit

=== Debug Warp and WebDriver

In order to debug Warp used together with WebDriver, one can use developer tools provided by browsers, such as:

* Chrome Developer Tools
* Firefox Developer Tools / Firebug
* IE Developer Tools
* Opera Dragonfly

and their ability to analyze Network traffic.

Refer to Graphene Reusable Session for best practices on how to develop with WebDriver.
