== Getting Started

=== Setting Up A Project

Just add impl module to classpath and run test either from IDE or maven.

....
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-warp</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0.Alpha4</version>
    <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
....

or any framework-specific extension:

....
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-warp-jsf</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0.Alpha4</version>
</dependency>
....

Use the servlet protocol in `arquillian.xml` configuration:

....
<defaultProtocol type="Servlet 3.0"/>
....

For more information on getting started, see documentation.

=== Writing Warp Tests

To allow your test to use the Warp, place a `@WarpTest` annotation to
the test class:

....
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@WarpTest
@RunAsClient
public class BasicTest {
}
....

CAUTION: Don't forget to force Arquillian to run the test on a client with a
`@RunAsClient` annotation.

==== Using `Warp` To Trigger The Client Action

//TODO fix new Link
You can use any HTTP client, such as WebDriver (driven by
https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ARQ/Drone[`@Drone`]), to trigger
the server logic:

....
@Drone
WebDriver browser;
....

Then use `Warp` utility class to run `initiate` method.

....
@Test
public void test() {

    Warp
       .initiate(new Activity() {

            public void perform() {
                browser.navigate().to(contextPath + "index.jsf");
            }})

       .inspect(new Inspection() {
            private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
        });
}
....

You need to provide `Activity` - the contract of this interface is that
its `perform` method leads to triggering one or more HTTP requests
against `contextPath` URL (injected by Arquillian).

Finally, in the `inspect` method, you need to provide object which
implements `Inspection` interface. This interface provides contract for
object which can execute server-side logic.

CAUTION: Don't forget to provide `serialVersionUID` for `Inspection` objects.

==== Asserting Server State With `Inspection`

In the `Inspection` implementation, you can provide test methods
annotated with lifecycle-test annotations:

* `@BeforeServlet`
* `@AfterServlet`
* `@BeforePhase`
* `@AfterPhase`

Simple assertion may look like:

....
new Inspection() {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Inject
    CDIBean cdiBean;

    @AfterPhase(RENDER_RESPONSE)
    public void test_initial_state() {
        assertEquals("John", cdiBean.getName());
    }
}
....

NOTE:  You can use dependency injection to bring the classes such as
CDI beans, EJB beans, or any other resource supported by Arquillian.
