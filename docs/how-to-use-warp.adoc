== How to Use Warp?

=== Project Setup

==== Setting Up Maven Dependencies

Following dependencies needs to be configured:

NOTE: Warp depchain (does contain support just for Servlets API)

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-warp</artifactId>
    <version>${version.warp}</version>
    <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
----

or JSF-specific binding:

----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.arquillian.extension</groupId>
    <artifactId>arquillian-warp-jsf</artifactId>
    <version>${version.warp}</version>
</dependency>
----

==== Use Servlet Protocol

In `arquillian.xml`:

----
<defaultProtocol type="Servlet 3.0"/>
----

==== Create a Test

The test needs to be annotated with `@WarpTest` and needs to be run on a client (`@RunAsClient`).

It needs to contain WAR deployment which will be testable:

----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
@WarpTest
@RunAsClient
public class BasicTest {

    @Deployment(testable = true)
    public static WebArchive deployment() {
       ...
    }

    @Test
    public void test() {
      // now we can use Warp
      Warp
        ...
    }
}
----

=== Warp API

The Warp requires two inputs from the user:

* what activity should be done in order to trigger a request
* how the server processing should be inspected

That intuitively leads us to the simplest possible high-level API:

----
Warp
  .initiate(Activity)
  .inspect(Inspection);
----

NOTE: This is a so called single-request execution API. In this API, the first observed request is inspected.

The result of single-request execution API is an `Inspection` returned from a server:

----
CustomInspection result =
  Warp
  .initiate(Activity)
  .inspect(CustomInspection);
----

=== Activity

The `Activity` is a manipulation with a client which leads to communication (emits a HTTP request). You are unlimited in tooling choices, but you should always use an URL provided by the Arquillian:

----
@ArquillianResource
URL contextPath;
----

So we can e.g. use simplest possible Warp activity:

----
Warp
  .initiate(new Activity() {
    InputStream connection = contextPath.getResourceAsStream();
    connection.open();
  }
----

You can use whatever tool you want here (e.g. HttpClient, Selenium WebDriver, etc.).

----
Warp
  .initiate(new Activity() {
    webdriver.navigate().to(contextPath.toString());
  }
----

=== Request Observers

Since HTTP clients can generally emit more than one request at a time, we may need to limit what will Warp react on.

We can achieve that using Warp API extended for Request Observing:

----
Warp
  .initiate(Activity)
  .observe(Observer)
  .inspect(Inspection);
----

In case of HTTP requests, we want to use `HttpObserver` specifically. We can implement our own or use predefined fluent API for observer specification.

==== Fluent API for HTTP Request Observing

In order to make observer definitions as accessible and readable as possible, there is fluent API for request observer specification:

----
import static ...request;
...
Warp
  .initiate(Activity)
  .observe(request().url().contains("index.html"))
  .inspect(Inspection);
----

=== Request Groups

An `Activity` inspected by `Warp` can lead not only to just one request, but also several parallel or sequential requests.

In order to test multiple requests during one `Warp` execution, you can use Request Groups API:

----
Warp
  .initiate(Activity)
  .group(id1)
    .observe(Observer)
    .inspect(Inspection...)
  .group(id2)
    .observe(Observer)
    .inspect(Inspection...)
  .execute();
----

NOTE: The identifiers (`id1`, `id2`) are optional, they serve just the purpose of identification of a group in a result.

CAUTION: Don't forget to use `.execute()` at the end of a Warp specification - it ends a specification and starts Warp execution process.

NOTE: The observers need to be used for each of the groups, since no request can belong to more than one group.

==== Multiple Requests per Group

The Request Group API can be used also for verification of multiple requests with same inspection:

----
Warp
  .initiate(Activity)
  .group()
    .count(2)
    .inspect(Inspection)
  .execute();
----

The definition above expresses that there are two similar requests expected which will be inspected by given Inspection.


==== Group Identifiers

For identification of a group, you can use arbitrary identifier (either primitive value or an object with correctly implemented equivalence), so e.g.:

----
   .group("group1")
   .group(1)
   .group(object);
   .group() // identifier is optional
----

==== Result of Warp Group Execution

As a result of non-trivial (not single-request) execution of a Warp is a `WarpResult`.

----
WarpResult result =
  Warp
  .initiate(Activity)
  .group(id)
    .inspect()
  .execute();
----

Once you have provided an identifier for a group, you can retrieve a `WarpGroup` result:

----
WarpGroup group = result.getGroup(id);
----

The `WarpGroup` result can be used to:

* obtain an inspection returned from the server
* verify the state of responses

=== Inspection

An initiated request can be inspected during its execution using

----
.inspect(new Inspection() {
  ...
})
----

An `Inspection` object

* is serialized on a client and sent to a server
* can bear a payload
* can contain lifecycle hooks which triggers verification logic
* can be enriched using dependency injection

=== Lifecycle Hooks

Once an inspection is transferred to a server VM, it can be used to assert a state.

In order to define, when the inspection should execute its logic, one needs to use so called request lifecycle hooks.

Most basic lifecycle hooks are:

|===
| `@BeforeServlet`  | executed before a servlet request enters servlet processing (in a servlet's filter chain)
| `@AfterServlet`   | executed after a servlet request leaves servlet processing (in a servlet's filter chain)
|===

The lifecycle hooks are used to invoke methods:

----
Warp
  .initiate(Activity)
  .inspect(new Inspection() {

    @BeforeServlet
    public void verifyRequest() {
      ...
    }
  });
----


There are also hooks specific for each of the supported frameworks.

==== JavaServer Faces Lifecycle Hooks

JSF allows to hook into the request lifecycle:

|===
| @BeforePhase(Phase) | executed before a given JSF lifecycle phase is processed
| @AfterPhase(Phase)  | executed after a given JSF lifecycle phase is processed
|===

=== Dependency Injection

In order to test server-side state effectively, the `Inspection` can be enriched with any of the dependencies injectable by Arquillian:

* `@Inject` for CDI beans
* `@EJB` for EJB beans
* `@ArquillianResource` for Arquillian Resources
* `@ManagedProperty("#{expression}")` for beans from Expression Language context (JSF)

The injection can be either at class-level or method-level:

----
Warp
  .initiate(Activity)
  .inspect(new Inspection() {

    @ArquillianResource
    private HttpServletRequest request;

    @ManagedProperty("#{user.friends}")
    private Set<User> friends;

    @AfterPhase(INVOKE_APPLICATION)
    public void verifyRequest(@CurrentUser User user) {
      ...
    }
  });
----

NOTE: As you can see in the sample above, CDI beans can be injected at method-level even though you don't specify `@Inject`.

==== Dependencies Specific to Servlets

Following resources can be injected using @ArquillianResource:

|===
| ServletRequest     | HttpServletRequest
| ServletResponse  | HttpServletResponse
|===

==== Dependencies Specific to JavaServer Faces

Following resources can be injected using @ArquillianResource:

|===
| FacesContext  | Application  | ExternalContext
| PartialViewContext  | ELContext  | ELResolver
| ExpressionFactory  | ViewHandler  | NavigationHandler
| ResourceHandler  | ExceptionHandler  | Flash
| RenderKit  | UIViewRoot  | StateManager
|===

=== Payload

Since an `Inspection` is a serializable object, it can contain a serializable payload which can be transferred with a request to a server, where it can be used as a base for a verification, for example:

* contain an object which will be used to initialize UI

Similarly, an `Inspection` processed on a server is serialized and sent to a client, thus it can contain an arbitrary information which can be used as a base for client verification logic, for example:

* provide a client with the locale information of a server
* provide identifiers for UI elements in the generated page DOM

Following is an example of how one can use payload:

----
class CustomInspection {
  private SomePayload payload;
  ...
}

CustomInspection inspection = Warp
  .initiate(Activity)
  .inspect(new CustomInspection(payload));

SomePayload payload = inspection.getPayload();
----


=== Ability to Transfer an Inspection

The `Inspection` object has to follow just one contract in order to be transferable from a client to a server VM: _all of its content has to be serializable_.

NOTE: Keep in mind that `Inspection` will be deployed to the server VM, so during its invocation, you can use only APIs available on server-side.

You can add desired APIs to the deployment and make them available to the server VM, but you should avoid exposing unwanted APIs to the server (e.g. API of client-side testing tools such as WebDriver).

WARNING: The execution of an inspection may lead to `ClassNotFoundException` or `LinkageError` if you don't stay compliant with this requirement.

==== Serializability of Anonymous/Inner Inspections

Anonymous and inner classes can be used as inspections due to transformation process which removes the binding from  non-static inner classes to top-level classes.

[NOTE]
.Keep in mind:
====
* you should not store a reference to a field in a top-level class
* the state of an inspection is serialized and thus its mutations on a server are not directly exposed to the client
====
