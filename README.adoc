== What is Warp ?

*Arquillian Warp fills the void between client-side and server-side testing.*

Warp extension allows you to write client-side test which asserts
server-side logic.

Using Warp, you can initiate a HTTP request using a client-side testing tool such as WebDriver and, in the same request cycle, execute in-container server-side tests. This powerful combination lets you cover integration across client and server.

Warp effectively removes a need for mocking and opens new possibilities for debugging.

*Warp has built-in support for following frameworks:*

* Servlet API
* JSF 2

and it also has several framework extensions:
